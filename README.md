ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yacqub 
- a technical founder and entrepreneur at heart. While I love building and scaling businesses, I also get hands-on with code when needed.

**Engineering Expertise**

As a full-stack developer, I have extensive experience with:

	â€¢	TypeScript, React Native, and React for building robust, mobile, and web applications.
	â€¢	Serverless computing and back-end API development, allowing me to design efficient, scalable architectures.
	â€¢	Full-stack development and system architecture, ensuring projects can grow seamlessly while remaining efficient.

I focus on building systems that are scalable, reliable, and tailored to business needs.

**Passion Projects**

When Iâ€™m not working on architecture and code for clients or my ventures, I love experimenting with:

	â€¢	Machine learning algorithms and LLMs, exploring innovative applications of AI.
	â€¢	Microcontrollers and control systems, building small robots and automation projects just for fun.
	â€¢	Exploring creative uses for Python in both practical and experimental tech.

Iâ€™m currently working on an exciting project that I canâ€™t wait to share. Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re into tech, startups, or anything in between!
