👋 Hi, I’m Yacqub 
- a technical founder and entrepreneur at heart. While I love building and scaling businesses, I also get hands-on with code when needed.

___
**Engineering Expertise**

As a full-stack developer, I have extensive experience with:
* TypeScript, React Native, and React for building robust, mobile, and web applications.
* Serverless computing and back-end API development, allowing me to design efficient, scalable architectures.
* Full-stack development and system architecture, ensuring projects can *scale* while remaining efficient.

I focus on building systems that are scalable, reliable, and tailored to business needs.
___
**Passion Projects**

When I’m not working on architecture and code for clients or my ventures, I love experimenting with:
* Machine learning algorithms and LLMs, exploring innovative applications of AI.
* Microcontrollers and control systems, building small robots and automation projects just for fun.
* Exploring creative uses for Python in both practical and experimental tech.

I’m currently working on an exciting project that I can’t wait to share. Let’s connect if you’re into tech, startups, or anything in between!
